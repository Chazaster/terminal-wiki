1. memory, assembly, compiler, custom
2. in the return line of code on the last line of the program, the options variable was -1 when it should have been choice.
3. $1 = 59
4. type = int[3]
5. the index is wrong because the int array can only hold so many numbers. when the number goes above the max number in int, the program crashes
